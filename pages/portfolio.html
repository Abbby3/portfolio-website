          This was my first project after being accepted into the Nology course. It is a mockup of a
          cafe website that was made to test our knowledge of HTML and CSS fundamentals, as well as
          some Javascript

        <div class="cafe__design">
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            The design is a parody of sorts, meaningless names and exorbitant prices. The colour
            scheme uses a simple coffee palette and features a gif of cafe-related stock footage.

        <div class="cafe__features">
          <h3 class="cafe__subtitle">Features</h3>
          <p class="cafe__desc">
            The project was specified to include the following features. A HTML website with 2
            seperate home and contact pages, both with a functional navigation bar and simple
            styling using CSS. A gallery on the home page in a 3 column grid. A form on the contact
            page using different required inputs on a CSS grid, that uses Javascript to store
            submitted inputs in the session storage. These inputs are displayed on a HTML element on
            the page, which can clear the messages both on the page, and within the session storage.

        <div class="cafe__updates">
          <h3>Updates</h3>
          <p>
            As my first application of web development, the site has a number of issues that would
            need to be resolved in future iterations. Examples of these changes include an updated
            file structure, a BEM based naming convention. The code should be widely updated to
            improve optimisation, readability and accessibility. The gif should ideally be of higher
            resolution, as the project was submitted through email at the time, which diminished the
            file size. Potentally, the design should be improved, and the messages on the contact
            page should be removed to align closer to a real cafe website, if the project were to
            move outside the intended scope, or be uploaded to a live release. A full list of
            features to be added is included in the readme.

          This project is the website you're on! It was my second project at Nology, and is used
          both to revise our knowledge thus far on HTML and SCSS, and as a platform for colleagues
          or employers to learn about my professional capabilities. I intend on regularly
          maintaining a live release of this website going forward, and using it as a blog or second
          resume of sorts.

        <div class="portfolio__design">
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            This website uses a simple icons, and a pink and blue colour scheme. The home page is
            simple and consise, in order for it to be understood at only a glance. The portfolio
            page delves into more information, so that users looking to view my work can read about
            it. Each section is held in a card to be recognisably distinct from each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio__features">
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <p>
            The features largely expand upon my previous project. For example, it uses flexbox
            rather than grids for a mobile first design, using BEM, and an improved file structure
            to name a few. The project specifications were overall less restrictive than the last,
            as this was to show our knowledge of the course material, rather than teach the basics.
            However, the website was required to have landing, about, skills, portfolio and contact
            sections. It was also specified to use SCSS for styling, a BEM naming convention, and
            media queries to ensure the UI on mobile screens was up to standard.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio__updates">
          <h3>Updates</h3>
          <p>
            This project is not on a live release as of the first version, which would be changed on
            future updates. Next iterations of the website should include various features such as a
            form and browser based email contact options, filters on the portfolio page, and live
            releases for other projects with comparisons to the first version. More features will be
            added as I learn and improve, and future projects will be uploaded to this website over
            time.
